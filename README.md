# PlaceApp

Simple android application that lets search informations about places in your neighbourhood and share them with your friends. First, you can login using your Facebook account, then explore interesting places nearby. 

App was created during my Android course at Computer science and the main goal of developing it was getting familiar with Facebook API, Google Places API, Google Maps and integrate them with Android project.
